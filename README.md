Simple maze game, testing the player's attention, reaction speed and agility.

### **Controllers**

Use WASD or the arrows to move Buppy forward, backward, left or right.

### **Workflow**

- The Player must help Buppy the Snail to reach to the Finish flag, by moving and dodging the obstacles in the forest.

- Each hit obstacle turns red and increases the score. After the first hit, the object doesn't affect de score anymore.

- The obstacles are:

    - spinning tree branches;

    - falling acorns;

    - rolling stones;

    - static sticks and tree branches;

    - small bushes;

    - a tree log;

    - tall grass, making a bush surrounding the arena.
